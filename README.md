# Game-of-Craps
Simple game of craps that I did on my spare time
Rule:
If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the bet wins. If the come-out roll is 2, 3 or 12, the bet loses (known as "crapping out"). If the roll is any other value, it establishes a point. If, with a point established, that point is rolled again before a 7, the bet wins.
